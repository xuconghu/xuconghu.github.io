Abstract: With the gradually widespread use of personification marketing, there is the phenomenon with extensive attention, the uncanny valley effect, that people ' s familiarity 
for robots decreases sharply with the increase of personification degree, further leading to compensatory consumption behavior based on the self-discrepancy theory and cause the 
illusion of 'marketing success'. This paper theoretically explores the essence of violation expectations as the uncanny valley effect, and designs a simulation scene experiment in which subjects make consumption decisions in different personification situations in the 
stimulation of language materials, so as to study the familiarity and compensatory consumption curves under different violation expectations. The results show that under the 
stimulation of language conditions, there is a familiarity curve similar to the uncanny valley effect and complementary compensatory consumption curve, and the threshold is calculated 
by fitting curve, within which the familiarity is the lowest and the compensatory consumption is the highest. The results provide empirical evidence to prove the violation of 
expectation hypothesis, and prove that there is also the uncanny valley effect in the language channel, and the threshold provides guidance for the development of artificial 
intelligence enterprises.
